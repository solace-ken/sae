        Otherwise, you might get browser errors like this:

        Refused to display 'https://www.google.com/' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'sameorigin'.

        External sites should also be secured with HTTPS

        Otherwise, you might get browser errors about Mixed Content:

        Mixed Content: The page at '/?tpl=iframe&src=http://solacenetwork.org' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure frame 'http://solacenetwork.org/'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.

        This can usually be set in the web server configuration files (e.g. .htaccess or Caddyfile)
