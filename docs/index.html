        <h2>SOLACE App Engine</h2>

        <p>SOLACE App Engine (SAE) is a system for storing and running multiple stand-alone Javascript applications all under one roof. Each of the apps that SOLACE App Engine can "run" is stored inside of the <b>app</b> directory in a separate folder. All of the apps are <b>stand-alone</b>. They can run by themselves, and function indepent from SOLACE App Engine. If you go directly to <b>/sae/app/name/</b>, you should be able to run the application by itself. Everything the Javascript app needs should be self-contained within the directory (scripts, stylesheets, templates, HTML files, images, ...everything!) Each of the applications is separate and unique.</p>
        
        <p>So, why SAE? The purpose of SOLACE App Engine was, originally, to provide a common set of libraries and functions for the six core apps being used by SOLACE Network. Each of these apps can function indepently, but, instead of having 6 separate copies of every Javascript library or image, it made more sense to have a single repository for all of them. Thus, SOLACE App Engine was born as a way to provide a common interface to access each of the six separate Javascript applications. Early iterations of SAE had a built-in menu system. But, it was more efficient to just convert the SOLACE Menu to be a stand-alone app and include with the six core apps. But, I kept thinking of ideas of new apps (or add-ons). I could keep exanding the "core apps" and, eventually, end up with like fifty of them but, that didn't make sense. The SOLACE codebase was already getting large and difficult to manage with only a few apps.</p>

        <p>This was the impetus for turning SOLACE App Engine into something stand alone too. The App Engine loads, checks the environement, and displays the SOLACE Menu app dynamically on any-sized device. From here, you can load the six core SOLACE apps: Directory, Education, Garden, Home, Library, Network. There is a button at the bottom of the screen which shows installed 3rd party apps. By 'installed', it just means there is a copy of the directory on the user's computer. There are stand-alone Javascript apps that run from a single directory in a browser using a web server (like Apache or ). There is also a button at the bottom of the screen which show additional apps available for installation. You can navigate the categories, click an app, view screenshots, description, reviews, ratings, and install or view status. </p>

        <p>SOLACE App Engine (SAE) does contain a set of "shared" or common libraries including: jQuery, Bootstrap, Boxicons, Bootrap Icons, etc. Each of the stand alone apps available on SOLACE is able to use these shared resources but, they are not required to. If a developer wants to include their own library instead of using the shared resources, they're free to do so. (Just remember: app size is displayed to the end-user before installation). The core apps from SOLACE and the SOLACE Menu all use the shared resources from SAE rather than duplicating the files in each sub-directory.</p>

        <p>Developers can write their apps to use either the SAE libraries (under "<a href="#vend">/lib/vendor/")</a> or a stand-alone copy of the library inside the folder where the app is running. You can add as many sub-folders and libraries as you need to your app as long as the total size of the folder stays below 100 MB (zipped). You can even write your code to toggle between SAE libaries and stand-alone dev libraries which are self-contained in the app, or you can make it a user preference. It's up to you, the developer.</p>

        <a name="api"></a>
        <h2>API</h2>
        <p>The API can be viewed at: /api/</p>
        <p>You can control the SOLACE App Engine with URL commands</p>
        <p>Examples:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="/sae/?tpl=logo" target="_blank">Use Logo Template<img class="extlink" src="/sae/lib/img/external-link.svg" width="20" height="20" title="Open in a new tab/window"></a></li>
                <li><a href="/sae/?tpl=spinner" target="_blank">Use Spinner Template<img class="extlink" src="/sae/lib/img/external-link.svg" width="20" height="20" title="Open in a new tab/window"></a></li>
                <li><a href="/sae/?tpl=error" target="_blank">Use Error Template<img class="extlink" src="/sae/lib/img/external-link.svg" width="20" height="20" title="Open in a new tab/window"></a></li>
                <li><a href="/sae/?tpl=iframe" target="_blank">Use iFrame Template<img class="extlink" src="/sae/lib/img/external-link.svg" width="20" height="20" title="Open in a new tab/window"></a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <a name="log"></a>
        <h2>Logger</h2>
        <p>The logger function provides custom logging for SAE. This allows you to use custom colors and labels.</p>

        <a name="mod"></a>
        <h2>Modules</h2>
        <p>Eventually modules will be: 
            <ul>
                <li>API</li>
                <li>Functions</li>
                <li>Logger</li>
                <li>Router</li>
                <li>Session</li>
                <li>Storage</li>
                <li>UI</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <a name="ui"></a>
        <h2>User Interface (UI)</h2>
        <p><h4>Reserved Words:</h4></p>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;"><b>&lt;div id="ui"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</b></p>
        <p>The main UI for SAE has a div with an id called 'ui'. This is the 'target div' for the entire SAE application. This id name ('ui') is a reserved SOLACE word which should be exclusive to the SOLACE App Engine. If multiple Javascript apps are all using the same IDs, it could result in Javascript errors. To avoid this problem, try using alternative div id names in your apps (e.g. 'wrapper', 'container', 'box', 'view', etc.). It would prevent any future confusion if you just named your own div something different. In the event of a conflict, the code will give preference to SAE functions first. This could result in Javascript errors in your 3rd party app running inside an iframe in SAE.</p>

        <a name="vend"></a>
        <h2>Extra Resources (vendor)</h2>
        <p>The <b>/lib/vendor/</b> directory contains copies of 3rd party scripts which come with their own license. They are provided here for your convenience. But, always feel free to grab the latest versions directly from the source and use your own code libraries. We try to keep up with version changes but, sometimes we fall behind. If you notice a 3rd party library which needs to be updated, please let us know.</p>
        <p><h4>3rd Party Vendor Libraries:</h4></p>

<!-- 
// DEV NOTE:
// 
// DATA has been separated from INFO in this version
//
// This program works with objects
// 
// To save or get data, you need to pass objects containing valid data
// They are referred to as 'get objects' or 'save objects' in the comments
// But, they are more like generic 'storage objects' tells the program what to do
// 
// This is an info request which seeks the value of a key named 'online'
// Example object 1: { "type":"info","key":"online" }
// This 'get object' would be submitted to the storage function 'getSaved()' 
// In this example, the function would return the value of the key 'online' (true or false)
// 
// This is a data request which saves data to a key named 'firstrun' (in this case, the value is 'true')
// Example object 2: { "type":"data", "key":"firstrun", "value":true }
// This 'save object' would be submitted to the storage function 'createSaved()'
// In the example, it would store a data value ('firstrun=true') to the 'SAE_Saved_Data' key.
//
// 
// Info = information related to the SAE program, the device, or the system environment / platform of the user (e.g. viewport dimensions)
// Data = data that needs to be saved. can be variables, temp data, preferences, flags, labels, etc. -- related to the user themselves (not their platform)
//   

// API info:
// This will probably consist of 2 different backend tools:
// PHP (for database access) and Javascript (for local access)
// Eventually, we'll' add Axios for better async functionality
//
// Primary methods:
//
// - Set - create or modify data in localstorage or remote db (via PHP)
// - Get - data from localstorage or remote db (via PHP)
// - Show/Hide - page ui elements, templates, etc.
// - Save - save file to localstorage or remote file system
// - Fetch - download file from local or remote file system -- TODO: not implemented yet
// - Status - online (network) status, current app, last app, errors, database status, handoff state
// - Info - engine meta-data, browser info, device info, timestamps, session data, etc
//
// Additional methods:
//
// - Action requests - control the app engine via action request (e.g. Load A Template: /?tpl=templateid)
// - Devmode - true | false
// - Test - true | false
// - Logging (On/Off + Verbosity) -- TODO: not implemented yet
//
// 
//
// Spinner requires spinner object containing header, image, and message
// /?tpl=spinner&w=700&h=250&data={"header":"This%20Is%20A%20Sample%20Heading","image":"gears","message":"This%20is%20A%20Sample%20Status%20Message"}
//
// Data in URLs should be passed in URI-encoded, valid JSON format
